Vue2Leaflet is a JavaScript library for the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework that wraps [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) making it easy to create reactive maps.

## How to install

``` bash
npm install vue-indoor leaflet --save
```

For more detailed informations you can follow the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)

## Breaking change from 1.x.x to 2.x.x

A new major release 2.0,0 is available and come with one breaking change:

### Leaflet is not automatically installed anymore

Leaflet is now a peerDependency and need to be installed manually, we updated our docs to reflect this but please pay attention when migrating

### Importing the library in Webpack / Rollup

Now the code of vue-indoor is split component by component (while using a bundler like Webpack/Rollup/Parcel) to do so the following syntax is not working anymore:

```javascript
import Vue2Leaflet from 'vue-indoor' // INVALID
```

And has been replaced by

```javascript
import * as Vue2Leaflet from 'vue-indoor' // VALID
```

Is highly suggested to import only the needed modules by doing so:

```javascript
import {LMap, LTileLayer, LMarker} from 'vue-indoor'
```

This will reduce the size of the bundle significantly

## Breaking changes from v0.x.x to v1.x.x

A new major release v1.x.x is available and come with some breaking changes.

### Components names

As some component where conflicting with reserved name like Circle with SVG Circle, from v1.x.x all components are prefixed with L.
For example Marker component became LMarker (l-marker in template).

### Events names

Event handling have been simplified and are now mapped directly to Leaflet event.
For example Marker move event was 'l-move' and became simply 'move'.

### Leaflet Controls

v1.0.0 introduces Leaflet Controls you can now use them using LControlAttribution, LControlLayers, LControlScale and LControlZoom.

When adding LControlAttribution or LControlZoom to your template, remember to desactivate the default one by using LMap options:

``` js
{
  zoomControl: false,
  attributionControl: false
}
```

Otherwise you will end up with two zoom/attribution control.
